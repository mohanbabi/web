        <h2>What is AI?</h2>
        <p>
            At its core, artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that
            are programmed to think and act like humans. These systems are designed to process data, learn from it,
            and make decisions autonomously.

        <h2>Applications of AI</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Healthcare: AI-driven diagnostic tools.</li>
            <li>Transportation: Self-driving cars.</li>
            <li>Finance: Fraud detection and risk analysis.</li>
            <li>Retail: Personalized shopping experiences.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Challenges and Ethical Concerns</h2>
        <p>
            Despite its potential, AI poses ethical challenges, such as bias in decision-making, job displacement,
            and privacy issues. Addressing these concerns will be critical to ensuring responsible AI development.
